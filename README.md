# UI Schema React Form Renderer

## Overview

This React application allows users to input a UI schema on the left side and preview the rendered form on the right-hand side. The application features a single screen divided into two equal sections. The left section provides a JSON editor for pasting the UI schema, while the right section dynamically renders a form based on the provided UI schema.

The project utilizes the [@rjsf/core](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form) library for efficient form rendering.
